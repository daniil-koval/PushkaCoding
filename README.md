Hi! My name is Daniil, I'm 26 years old.

On May 1st, 2025, I left my job in sales to study programming and change my career path.
I've made a clear decision to pursue web development with Java.

This is my personal learning project. I've committed to becoming a Java backend web developer,
and I'm documenting my journey to better understand the material and share the process.
There may be mistakes — don't take everything here as absolute truth.
If you're learning — welcome. If you're an expert — feel free to correct me.
